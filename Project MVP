Analysis of the Hotel Booking

The goal of this project is to predict if a guest will actually come or he will cancel the resrvation,
it will be usefull for hotels if they have model like this to offer more rooms or take a retainer from the client before the resrvation.

To start exploring this goal, I used a linear regression model with one feature to describe Box Office Total Domestic Gross as a function of the Budget of a Movie.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
