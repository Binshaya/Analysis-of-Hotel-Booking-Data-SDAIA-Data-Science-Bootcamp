## Analysis of the Film Industry

The goal of this project is to better understand which factors are most important in driving film revenue, and how those factors relate to film revenue.

To start exploring this goal, I used a linear regression model with one feature to describe Box Office Total Domestic Gross as a function of the Budget of a Movie.

The figure depicts the model (red) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in green.

This result suggests that budget may have a significant positive impact on a film's revenue. However, the magnitude of the model's residuals makes it clear that budget is not the only important factor in determining the success of a film.
